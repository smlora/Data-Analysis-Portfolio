## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Classifier
**Code:** [CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN (Keras)](https://github.com/smlora/cifar10-cnn/blob/main/notebooks/Steven_Lora_MSIT675_Project1.ipynb))

**Goal:** To build and train a Convolutional Neural Network capable of accurately classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving at least 85% validation accuracy within 40 epochs.

**Description:** This project focused on classifying a dataset of 60,000 color images (10 classes) using a deep learning model. The dataset included images of airplanes, animals, vehicles, and more. The model was developed in Keras with TensorFlow backend and trained using data augmentation and dropout for regularization. Performance was tracked using accuracy and loss metrics throughout training.

**Skills:** deep learning, image classification, CNN architecture design, data preprocessing, model evaluation, visualization.

**Technology:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** The final CNN model achieved over 85% validation accuracy by the 40th epoch. Training results, model architecture, and performance metrics are all documented in the notebook.
