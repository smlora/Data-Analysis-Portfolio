## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Classifier
**Code:** [CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN (Keras)](https://github.com/smlora/cifar10-cnn/blob/main/notebooks/Steven_Lora_MSIT675_Project1.ipynb)

**Goal:** To build and train a Convolutional Neural Network capable of accurately classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving at least 85% validation accuracy within 40 epochs.

**Description:** This project focused on classifying a dataset of 60,000 color images (10 classes) using a deep learning model. The dataset included images of airplanes, animals, vehicles, and more. The model was developed in Keras with TensorFlow backend and trained using data augmentation and dropout for regularization. Performance was tracked using accuracy and loss metrics throughout training.

**Skills:** deep learning, image classification, CNN architecture design, data preprocessing, model evaluation, visualization.

**Technology:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** The final CNN model achieved over 85% validation accuracy by the 40th epoch. Training results, model architecture, and performance metrics are all documented in the notebook.

### Fashion MNIST Image Generator with CGAN
**Code:** [Fashion MNIST Image Generation with Conditional GAN](https://github.com/smlora/fashion-mnist-cgan/blob/main/notebooks/Steven_Lora_MSIT675_Project2.ipynb)

**Goal:** To train a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) capable of generating realistic grayscale images of specific fashion items (trousers, pullovers, and sneakers) conditioned on class labels from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

**Description:** This project focused on generative modeling using deep learning. A CGAN architecture was developed using Keras and TensorFlow, where both the generator and discriminator received class label inputs to guide image creation and evaluation. The dataset was filtered to include only three clothing categories, which were re-labeled for simplified conditioning. The generator learned to produce visually coherent images aligned with the intended category over thousands of training iterations.

**Skills:** generative modeling, deep learning, conditional GAN architecture, image synthesis, class conditioning, model evaluation, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

**Results:** The model successfully generated class-specific fashion images, showing clear visual differentiation between trousers, pullovers, and sneakers. The notebook includes generated image grids and training progression for interpretability and evaluation.

### IMDB Sentiment Analysis & Text Generation with LSTM and GPT-2
**Code:** [IMDB Sentiment Analysis and Text Generation (LSTM & GPT-2)](https://github.com/smlora/imdb-nlp-sentiment/blob/main/notebooks/Steven_Lora_MSIT675_Project3.ipynb)

**Goal:** To classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a Bidirectional LSTM model, and to fine-tune a GPT-2 model to generate realistic, positively-biased movie reviews based on the IMDB dataset.

**Description:** This project explores both sentiment classification and generative text modeling using deep learning. First, a bidirectional LSTM was trained from scratch to perform binary sentiment classification. Next, the project fine-tuned a pretrained GPT-2 model to generate positive reviews in the style of the IMDB dataset. Finally, the generated reviews were evaluated for positivity using the previously trained sentiment classifier, closing the loop between generation and prediction.

**Skills:** natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, sequence modeling, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTM architecture, text generation, transfer learning, evaluation metrics.

**Technology:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, GPT-2 (via Keras Hub or Hugging Face), NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

**Results:** The LSTM model achieved strong performance in binary sentiment classification. The fine-tuned GPT-2 was able to generate coherent positive movie reviews, which were then successfully identified as positive by the sentiment classifier â€” demonstrating a feedback loop between generative and predictive models.
